# Details:
#   This project was done as part of the computer science program at Clark College.
#   In the winter term of computer science students' final year in the program, we were
#   to come up with a personal programming project it and execute it by June 6th.
#   This program- The Bioinformatics Showcase- was chosen to get my feet wet in the'
#   field of bioinformatics, as I had previously not had much experience.
